## **I. Overview**

### Why WEave CAN?

**WEave CAN** is a digital solution designed to empower Filipino weavers by streamlining inventory and order management. It addresses the challenges of manual business operations, enabling artisans to focus on their craft while improving efficiency and market access.

### Key Features:

  Add, update, and monitor stock levels for products like shawls, bags, and blankets.  
- **Order Management**:  
  Automatically adjust stock and manage customer orders seamlessly.  
- **Reporting**:  
  Generate sales reports to make informed business decisions.  
- **User Roles**:  
  Supports **Weaver** (artisan-focused) and **Admin** (management-focused) roles.  
- **Order History & Cancellation**:  
  View and cancel orders easily.  
- **Discount Management**:  
  Admins can apply promotional discounts to products.  

This project supports market expansion, business sustainability, and cultural preservation for Filipino artisans.

## **II. Python Principles**

**WEave CAN** follows fundamental Python principles to ensure code clarity, maintainability, and scalability:

### 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Encapsulation**:  
  Data and methods are encapsulated within classes, making the code modular.  
- **Inheritance**:  
  Core entities like `User`, `Weaver`, and `Admin` share properties and methods through inheritance.  
- **Polymorphism**:  
  Methods behave differently depending on the object type, such as processing orders for different user roles.

### 2. **Code Readability**
- The program adheres to Python’s philosophy of clean, readable code, as promoted by **PEP 8**.

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Robust error handling ensures the system remains reliable and prevents crashes due to invalid inputs.

### 4. **Dynamic Typing**
- Python's dynamic typing allows for quick prototyping and adaptability in variable usage.

### 5. **Reusability**
- Functions and classes are designed to promote reusability, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

4. **Community Upliftment**  
   Enhances opportunities for indigenous and rural communities by creating sustainable economic activities.

5. **Inclusive Growth**  
   Promotes gender equality and inclusivity by empowering female artisans, who are often the primary weavers.
