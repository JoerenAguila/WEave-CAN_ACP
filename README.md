## **III. Explanation of Python Concepts and Libraries**

**WEave CAN** leverages key Python features to deliver a robust, scalable system:  

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Classes and Inheritance**:  
  Core entities like `User`, `Weaver`, and `Admin` are implemented using Python classes. Subclasses reuse and extend functionality from parent classes.  
- **Encapsulation**:  
  Encapsulated data within classes ensures modularity.  
- **Polymorphism**:  
  Methods adapt seamlessly to different object types, such as `Product` instances.  

### 2. Modules and Libraries  
- **`random`**:  
  Generates unique order IDs for tracking.  

### 3. Error Handling  
- Functions ensure validation of inputs and handle invalid cases gracefully.  

### 4. Inventory and Order Management  
- The `Product` class manages stock and pricing, while the `Order` class tracks transactions.  

### 5. Admin Functionality  
- Features like generating reports and applying discounts are included for business management.  

### 6. User Interface  
- A user-friendly menu-driven CLI improves usability.
